# Wine-Scoring-Analysis

Overview:

We chose a dataset describing Portuguese wine, looking specifically at judge rating based on region, year, grape species, color, alcohol percentage, producer, and average price. This will allow us to understand what factors affect the judge rating and thus save money and make informed choices when choosing which wine to select. We are assuming that a higher judge’s rating corresponds to a higher enjoyment value for the average wine-drinker, which may not be the case, but we are using Judge Rating Score as a quantitative score for the quality of the wine. Due to the vast number of Portuguese wines and the variety within, this will give knowledge about grape species and producers and help those who read it become efficient consumers. With this information, we will see which factors contribute to a higher judge’s rating. We predict that color and grape species will have some collinearity, as will region and producer. Alcohol content will react based on grape species and year, as well as variables not in this dataset, such as type of barrel used and fermentation process.


Dependent Variable:

Judge Rating Score
The dependent variable is the content that is being or has been tested and measured through an experiment or judgement. In the attached dataset, the most important dependent variable is the judge rating score of a wine. The numerical values in the ‘judge rating’ column is a score from 0 to 20 given by the wine critic judge. The higher the score, the better rating the judge gave considering the qualitative and quantitative values derived from multiple independent variables present. In the analysis, we will assume this score to be a direct determinable factor for quality and enjoyment of the wine from other perspectives. We predict each independent variable listed below will hold different weights in contribution to the judge rating score.


Independent Variables:


Region, Year, Color, Grape Species, Alcohol Percentage, Producer, Average Price
Total Observations: 2993 different wines classified by names and year ripened.
This dataset filtered items that have had at least one or more NULL / NA / empty data recorded.
Independent variable is the major cause to change the result of the dependent variable. Each independent variable contributes a certain percentage to determine the judge’s rating of a wine. During our analysis, we will assume that there is an unequal weight in each of these independent variables that directly or indirectly contribute to judge rating score.
Out of all the listed independent variables, we predict year ripened, region, and grape species will have the most and direct effect on the Judge Rating. Thus, by researching each independent variable, we will be able to predict how each independent variable affect the Judge Rating score.
